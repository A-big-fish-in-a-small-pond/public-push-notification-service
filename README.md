What is PPNS?

It's a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages for free. Inspired by Firebase Cloud Messaging, it was developed for development implementation and customization. Firebase cloud messaging systems implement servers as firebase servers, but they allow you to implement servers directly.
